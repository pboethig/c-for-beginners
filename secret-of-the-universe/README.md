A minimal c program simple.c:

This simple script 
- includes the Standard Input Output Helper Class
- Defines the main method, which will be executed by the compiler first
- In the main method a local integer variable named "number" ist defined and the value 42 will be referenced
- at last you tell the compiler that a string and your variable 42 will be printed on the screen.

After you have saved the file with name "simple.c" you type in the shell command

g++ simlple.c -o simlpe

this tells the c comliler to compile your sourcecodefile named simple.c to the executable file "simple", wich can be executed wit the command

./simple on your console

That is all.

Now you see the answer to all questions on you console

Great fun!
