A minimal c program simple.c:

This simple script 
- includes the Standard Input Output Helper Class
- Defines the mainmethod, which is a kind of a constructor
- In the main method a local integer variable named "number" ist defined with the value 42
- a string with the answer 42 will be printed on the screen.

After you have saved the file with name "simple.c" you type in the shell commanc
g++ simlple.c -o simlpe

this tells the c comliler to compile a file named simple.c to the programm "simple", wich can be executed wit the command

./simple

That all.

Now you see the answer to all questions on you console
